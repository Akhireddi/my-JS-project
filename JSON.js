/**JSON JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.
  => It is a lightweight data format used to store and exchange data between a server and a client (browser).
  => JSON is text-based (a string format).
  => It looks very similar to JavaScript objects, but itâ€™s always written in double quotes and has stricter rules.
JSON is language-independent (can be used in Java, Python, C#, etc.), but it was inspired by JavaScript object syntax.
